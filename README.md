This is a handler for sensu (https://sensuapp.org/) that relays alerts to slack (https://slack.com/).

It is written in python.

There is another, more featureful, probably better "official" slack handler for sensu at https://github.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins-slack .

I couldn't get multi-channel support to work with that one.  

It was easier to write this one in python than to debug that one's ruby.  

The first s in sslack stands for samba, http://samba.tv, my employer who made this possible and necessary.
